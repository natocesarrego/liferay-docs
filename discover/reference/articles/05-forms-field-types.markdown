# Form Field Types

The essence of a form is the form field. Out of the box, Liferay Forms gives you
many useful and highly configurable field types.

Form Text
: Users do not enter data into Form Text fields. The form creator enters text
that form users see displayed on the form. This is useful for longer
instructions.

Text Field
: Users enter text into these fields. For example, a Full Name field will often
be a text field. By default, a text field keeps all input on a single line of
text. To accommodate longer responses, choose the multiline setting when
configuring the text field.

Select List
: Users select one (or more, if configured to allow it) options from a dropdown
list of choices. Choices can be entered manually or automatically populated by a
data provider. For example, a Country of Origin field would probably be a select
list field populated by a countries of the world data provider.

Single Selection
: Using a radio button, users select one option from a list of options displayed
on the form.

Date
: Users select a date using a datepicker. For example, a Birth Date field would
probably use the Date field type.

Multiple Selection
: Users select one or more options from check boxes (or switchers, if
configured).

Grid
: Using radio buttons, users select from options laid out in rows and columns.
One selection can be made per row. This is useful when the same response metric
is needed for multiple questions. For example, a product survey form might ask
users to rate a list of their product's characteristics as Wonderful, Pretty
Good, Not So Good, or Awful.

Numeric
: Users enter numeric data (integers or decimals) into numeric fields.
Non-number input is not accepted. For example, configure a numeric field that
accepts integers to ask users how many children they have.

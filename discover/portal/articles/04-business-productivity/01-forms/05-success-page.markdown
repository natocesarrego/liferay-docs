# Form Success Pages

Once a user submits one of your whiz-bang forms, what next? How will they know
they're done, and can close the browser window or tab? What if they think their
submission didn't go through, and wonder if they need to fill out the whole form
again? By default, submitting a form brings you back to the first page of the
form, and it's now blank. Don't leave users feeling lost, relying on the default
success message to assure them that their form entry was successfully submitted.
Instead, configure a Success Page.

The success page is simple. It has a title in bold text, and a description
beneath the title. A common alternative to using a success page is to [redirect
users to a different page in your site](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-advanced-forms#redirecting-users-after-form-submission).

The success page is a terminal page that just gives form users a message that
they've finished filling out the form and their submission was received
successfully. A success page can even urge users to close the browser window or
tab.

What should you put in the success page? Whatever you want, but you can try
this if you are a serious individual with a serious form:

If you're writing a success page for a more "fun" form, like a registration form
for a dog sled race, you can be more playful:

To configure a success page, you must be in the form builder. Click on the form
page's Action (![Actions](../../../images-dxp/icon-actions.png)) button and
choose *Add Success Page*.

Once the success page is added to your form, fill in the Title and Description
fields however you please. When the form is Saved and Published, the Success
Page is live for your form users!

**Note:** You can't preview the success page. If you configure a success page
and then click the Preview Form link in the form builder, the form's regular
pages can be previewed (use the Next button to navigate through the form). In
order to see a success page, the form entry must be submitted, but form entries
cannot be submitted while previewing the form.

Success pages help your users feel that their form experience is complete.  They
allow you to craft a suitable message to assure form users that everything is
working as expected. Use success pages if you don't need to [direct users
somewhere else in your site](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-advanced-forms#redirecting-users-after-form-submission)
after completing the form submission.

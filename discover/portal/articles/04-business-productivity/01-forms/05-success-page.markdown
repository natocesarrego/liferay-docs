# Form Success Pages

Once a user submits one of your whiz-bang forms, what next? Don't leave them
feeling lost, wondering whether their form entry was truly submitted, and
whether they should fill the form out again. Instead, configure a Success Page. 

The success page is simple. It has a title in bold text, and a description beneath
the title. If you want to redirect users to a different page in your site, use a
[redirect page](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-advanced-forms#redirecting-users-after-form-submission). The redirect page is a terminal page taht just gives form users a message that they've finished filling out the form and their submission was received successfully.

So what should you put in the success page? Whatever you want, but you can try
this if you are a serious individual with a serious form:

If you're writing a success page for a more "fun" form, like a registration form
for a dog sled race, you can be more playful:
